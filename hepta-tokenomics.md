# HEPTA TOKENOMICS

&#x20;      All transactions to be made in HEPTAGON will be stored on the Blockchain, integrated with the BSC network.&#x20;

&#x20;     A total of 360,000,000 units of HEPTA TOKEN have been produced in the BSC network in BEP20 format and are in fixed supply.&#x20;

&#x20;    HEPTAs held as reserves will be burned and withdrawn from the market in the process.&#x20;

&#x20;    Thus, HEPTA TOKEN is not with an increasing supply in the market, but HEPTA TOKEN with a reduced supply and ultimately a constant supply was created. If Softcap is not available, the HEPTAGON team will cover HEPTAGON developments from its own budget.&#x20;

&#x20;      40% of Softcap's budget will be dedicated to HEPTAGON developments and 60% to Marketing.&#x20;
