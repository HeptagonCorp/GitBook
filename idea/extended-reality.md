Virtual Reality (VR) :&#x20;

The use of computer technology to create an environment that takes place in the real world, like an environment or an area in the real world is something that Users will have the chance to feel and enjoy. Here also the viewer will be able to jump into a similar swimming pool of the real world, for example, designed always in 3D. A person who does this with VR glasses will experience the same way in the real experience as VR glasses will experience a 3-dimensional drop in the moment of falling into the pool.‚Äù In a sense, the Virtual Reality field wins the feeling that with the help of Virtual Reality glasses, entered into this area. Or as in a virtual reality driving test, the user gains experience as if they are driving a real car. Because in this environment, our users will be living a view of reality. As in a real road, the virtual one progresses in the form of a view of truth, and the reactions it has given result in a response to the events that occur.&#x20;

Augmented Reality:&#x20;

We can think of Augmented Reality as Virtual Reality with one foot in the real world: Augmented Reality simulates artificially created objects in a real environment; Virtual Reality creates an artificial environment to live in. Or it builds an artificial environment to live in virtual reality. In Augmented Reality, the computer uses sensors and algorithms to determine the position and orientation of a camera. AR technology then renders the 3D graphics as they appear from the camera's perspective, superimposing computer-generated images over a user's real-world view. Here, the camera's point of view moves according to the user's eyes, activating the user.&#x20;

Mixed Reality:&#x20;

Mixed reality, on the other hand, is the merging of the real world and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects can co-exist and interact in real-time.&#x20;

Extended Reality:&#x20;

Extended reality, on the other hand, is a concept that covers all of the above-mentioned reality fields. In augmented reality, with virtual wearable VR glasses and VR wearable helmets, people can move in a projection of reality, and interact with artificially created objects, just like in virtual reality.
