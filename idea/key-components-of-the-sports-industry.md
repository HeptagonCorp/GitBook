&#x20;    The ultimate goal of organizations operating in  the Sports Economy  is to  make a profit. In this sense, many sports organizations  and  their supporters   operate in this sector.  Business  organizations   in  sports   include   professional  sports  franchises, leagues, and other  sports  organizations (eg Sky  Blue FC, SKA Saint Petersburg, Los Angeles Sparks,  Ultimate  Fighting Championship); sports providers (for example, ski resorts,  golf,   fitness   clubs,    bungee   jumping    facilities,  zorbing  facilities,  event management  firms,   sports  marketing  agencies,   sports  facilities  contractors  and operators);  sporting  goods  manufacturers  (e.g.  Nike,  Russell, New Balance, Head) and retailers (e.g. Dick's Sporting Goods, Foot Locker);  sports media (e.g. ESPN, NBC Sports, NFL Network, The Hockey News); and companies  that  support  the  industry with sports sponsorships (e.g. Coca-Cola, Visa, McDonald's, Budweiser). Commercial establishments are at the center of the operations of the  entire  sports  industry  and serve   an  important  function  of   providing   sports   products  and  services  to  the population.
